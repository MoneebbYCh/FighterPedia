This is an app made on React Native called 'Fighter Pedia'.

Main Idea: 
Fighter Pedia is an iPhone app that presents fighter planes’ maniacs with information on over
ninety fighter planes. It allows user to compare different fighter planes, set them as wallpapers
and guess the planes.
Fighter Pedia has information on various planes manufactured between 1900 and 2010. It has
at least eight pictures of each plane from varying angles with a detailed description about it’s
year of manufacture, combat history, avionics, pricing etc.
